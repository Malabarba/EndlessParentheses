Install JDEE! Ok, maybe that’s an overstatement. JDEE is far from simple, and it
hasn’t been able to keep up very well since Java 1.4. However, thanks to Stephen
Leake &amp; folks, that might be starting to change. <a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/">JDEE is now on Github</a>, and it
could definitely use your help.
</p>

<p>
Stephen has already been updating the code base for the recent Emacs versions,
and other people have shown interest in this as well. There are already some
<a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/issues">productive discussions</a> going on in the issues, and some of those items are
things anyone could do. So if you like Emacs and you use Java, now this is a
great chance to give something back.
</p>

<p>
However, if JDEE is not to your taste, don’t forget you have <a href="https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim">emacs-eclim</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode">malabar-mode</a> too. I’ve never used malabar-mode myself, but last time I had to
deal with Java I gave eclim a try and it worked pretty well. You do need an
eclipse server running in the background, but once you do it facilitates a good
amount of features.
