I wish I had reviewed this book when it first came out, over one year ago. Alas,
those were busier times and this piece of work deserved more than a short post
hastily written between seminars and group meetings. Fortunately, Mickey has
unknowingly gifted me a second opportunity, by making it half-off for its 1 year
anniversary, and you have until tomorrow to grab the discount.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to technical reading, it’s rare to find a book that is both packed
with content and high in quality. Anyone who’s ever written a long document will
tell you how difficult it is to maintain a consistent level of quality
throughout the pages. Somewhere around the 100th or so page the complexity
spirals out of control and you spend more time organizing the chapters (to avoid
repetition or maintain the ideal order) than actually writing anything.
</p>

<p>
And yet, somehow, Mastering Emacs masterfully delivers on both areas, clearly
showing itself as a labor of love, and a whole lotta sweat and hard work. The
book’s beautiful cover smoothly gives way to an interior that is consistently
easy on the eyes and a pleasure to read. Most importantly, all of this eye-candy
is made all the sweeter by the healthy dose of knowledge that lies underneath.
</p>

<p>
If you’re a relative newcomer to Emacs (and I say "relative newcomer" in the
broadest sense), this book will be your initiation into the cult. It starts with
an entire chapter on "The Way of Emacs", before it ever mentions keybinds or
commands, which is exactly how I’d start a book as well. Once that is done, it
goes on to teach you hundreds of pages of Emacs fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
If I had to be nit-picky, it’s hard to say whether these first few chapters are
too long or just about right. When it comes to introducing new concepts, the
ideal speed varies largely from reader to reader anyway. I also disagree with
recommending starter kits, but that’s about all the criticism I can come up
with for a couple hundred of pages.
</p>

<p>
Given all of the above, it’s very easy to recommend Mastering Emacs to Emacs
beginners. They are, after all, the target audience of this book, and they’ll
probably still be digesting its lessons 6 months from now.
</p>

<p>
But what about intermediate to advanced users? Despite not being the target
audience, it’s far from a worthless experience for them. The thing to understand
is that whenever a guru like Mickey puts down so many thoughts into words,
everyone is bound to learn something.
</p>

<p>
In particular, chapters 4, 5, and 6, contain a large collection of fairly
advanced tips. These are actually quite short, to the point that I was
frequently left wishing for more (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but
they’re usually just enough to get you started with the feature. Any
intermediate user is sure to not know many of them, and even advanced users
might benefit from a few. For instance, chapter 4 finally convinced me to try
Helm, and chapter 6 made me wonder why I never use Emacs to read log files.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not a few new ideas wrapped in a beautiful package is worth the price
being asked is entirely up to you (and, I suppose, up to how the price
translates in your currency). All I can say is that I’m happy for this book, and
I’m secretly wishing for a second volume.
