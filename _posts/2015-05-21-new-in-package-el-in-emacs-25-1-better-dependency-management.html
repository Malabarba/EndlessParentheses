title: "New in Emacs 25.1: Better dependency management"

<p>
Package.el has gotten a series of improvements after the release of 24.4.
Since I’ve found that people like to read about upcoming features, I’m starting
a new series exclusively about our favorite package manager. Today, we talk
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Package.el’s dependency management has always been just enough to do the job
it’s supposed to do. If you install a package that has dependencies, those
requirements get installed as well. End of story.
</p>

<p>
This leaves a little to be desired for two reasons. Firstly, if you later remove
the first package, the dependencies will be left on your computer. Secondly,
even if you notice those dependencies lying around and want to remove them, you
never know if that’s safe because Package.el won’t tell you if another package
depends on them and, what’s worse, it will let you remove it even if another
installed package does depend on them (which will lead to breakage).
</p>

<p>
The situation is being improved on both accounts, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto">Thierry Volpiatto</a>.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Package.el will differentiate between packages you’ve installed explicitly
and those which were just pulled along as dependencies. So you get a new
<code>package-autoremove</code> command to cleanup dependencies that are no longer
needed.
</li>
<li>Package.el will never let you remove a package if some other package depends
on it. So you’re free to try to delete anything you don’t want, and nothing
is going to break if it happens to be a dependency (you’ll just fail).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And this led to some UI improvements to the package menu, thanks to yours truly.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Packages that were pulled in as dependencies are marked as such in the
package menu.
</li>
<li>The description buffer (the one you get when hitting <kbd>RET</kbd> on a package) is
now kind enough to list all packages that depend on this one.
</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
As a whole, this is a great user experience improvement. Instead of seeing
<code>installed</code> packages that they never actually installed, the user will see
<code>dependency</code> packages. Every once in a while, after removing some package, they
might get notified that <i>“these dependencies are no longer necessary”</i>, and can
easily clean them up with <code>package-autoremove</code>.
