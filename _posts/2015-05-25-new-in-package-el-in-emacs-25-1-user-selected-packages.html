<p>
In <a href="/new-in-package-el-in-emacs-25-1-better-dependency-management.html">Thurday's post</a> on dependency management, I briefly mentioned that
<code>package.el</code> now keeps track of which packages the user explicitly requested,
and which were pulled in as dependencies. But there’s a bit more to this
feature, so it deserves some time in the spolight.
</p>

<p>
Simply put, there is now a new custom variable <code>package-selected-packages</code>. This
variable stores the names of packages installed explicitly by user. So every
time you do <kbd>M-x</kbd> <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/package-install"><code>package-install</code></a> or you do <kbd>i x</kbd> in the Package Menu, the
name of that package gets added to this list. Packages which get pulled in as
dependencies are <b>not</b> added to this list, and those which are explictly deleted
get removed from the list. This is how <code>package-autoremove</code> knows what to
remove, it just finds packages which <i>(a)</i> are not on this list and <i>(b)</i> are
not required by anything else.
</p>

<p>
But this variable comes with other benefits too. First, the user can edit it
manually with the usual <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/customize-variable"><code>customize-variable</code></a> and use it to keep track of their
list of wanted packages. Second, there’s now another command,
<code>package-install-selected-packages</code>, which ensures that all packages on the
list are installed. This means you can safely move to a new computer, or even
just delete your <code>elpa/</code> subdir. As long as you keep your custom settings you
can just invoke the command and all your packages will be reinstalled.
</p>

<p>
There’s one small caveat, which some of you may have noticed. This bookkeeping is
done during installation. So, when you finally upgrade to Emacs 25.1, how is it
going to know which of your installed packages were user-selected and which were
dependencies?
</p>

<p>
Well, it’s just impossible to know for sure, so it makes an educated guess. It
takes all installed packages that are not required by any other installed
package, and considers them to have been explicitly installed. This can (and
probably will) yield both false positives and negatives, but that only happens
the very first time you start Emacs 25. So just keep in mind you may need to
<code>customize-variable</code> and fine-tune this list.
