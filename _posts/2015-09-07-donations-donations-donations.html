Every computer user, to some extend, is a user of Open Source Software (even if
most of them are oblivious to that). This is only possible because the
developers of these pieces of software have donated their time to us, who are
nothing short of complete strangers to them. These are regular people, with just
as much free time as you or I&#x2014;sometimes a bit more, sometimes even less.
</p>

<p>
There are many ways we can thank them for this. Just saying “thank you” is one
way, anyone likes to be appreciated and would be happy to hear that they did
something that helped you. Another way is to spread the word, share the
software, and thus help them help more people. A third option is to help back,
send a patch or a PR, write documentation, or even write your own software to
help your own complete strangers, adding one more link to this selfless chain.
And lastly, you can also donate.

A few weeks ago, I setup a Gratipay page for Endless Parentheses. If you’d like
to help, you can donate to the blog or to my packages by clicking on the button
below.

<a href="https://gratipay.com/endless-parentheses/" onclick="javascript:ga('send', 'event', 'Button', 'Click', 'Gratipay Button');" target="_blank"><img src="/images/gratipay.svg" class="centered-image" alt="Say thanks on Gratipay"/></a>

<p>
But that was weeks ago, it was something else that prompted me to write this
post today. Over the last four days, two of Emacs most popular packages have
setup new donation channels, so I saw this as a chance to group all these links
together into a post.

<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/639456568300470272">CIDER</a> now has <a href="https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/cider">a page on Salt</a> (Bountysource’s new monthly donations scheme), and
<a href="https://twitter.com/magit_emacs/status/640585548806135812">Magit</a> has got its <a href="https://gratipay.com/magit/">Gratipay page</a> up and running again after some down time. Both
of these are true feats of Emacs development, way beyond your usual weekend
programming exercise, so consider donating if they make your life easier. They
also offer several other channels, so see these links to their respective
manuals.

Bastien Guerry points out that Org-mode now has <a href="https://gratipay.com/org-mode/">Gratipay page</a> as well. You can
also donate to it directly on <a href="http://orgmode.org/">the website</a> (top-right corner). Another huge and
important Emacs project I forgot to mention before is Flycheck, and you can find
it’s Paypal link on <a href="https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck#readme">the Readme</a>.
