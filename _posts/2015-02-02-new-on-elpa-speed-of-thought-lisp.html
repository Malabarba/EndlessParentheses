When your computer is feeling slow and you decide to upgrade it, where do you
start? You start by finding the bottleneck, of course. That awesome CPU won't do
you any good with crappy RAM disk. The same logic holds for your coding skills.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you're writing code, there are two main processes going on &#x2014;this is a
very rough model, but it gets the job done.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You think of what you'll write,
</li>
<li>and you write it. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As you become more experienced with a language, the first part gets faster and
easier, to the point where you can immediately envisage the solution to any
problem you encounter. On the other hand, your actual writing speed is much
slower to improve, and caps at a very disappointing maximum.
</p>

<p>
The solution? Upgrade the bottle-neck, i.e., your hands. <code>speed-of-thought-lisp</code>
(or <code>sotlisp</code>) is all about helping your hands keep up with your brain. The mode
itself is quite simple, it provides two sets of tools to help your fingers follow
your thought-flow. To turn it on, just issue <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>speed-of-thought-mode</code>.
While you're at it, make sure you've got something like <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/electric-pair-mode"><code>electric-pair-mode</code></a> or
<code>paredit</code> active, <code>sotlisp</code> is a lot more fluid with these.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Minimal typing with abbrevs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A large number of intelligent abbrevs which expand a function's initials to its
name. A few examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>i</b> → <code>insert</code>
</li>
<li><b>a</b> → <code>and</code>
</li>
<li><b>r</b> → <code>require '</code>
</li>
<li><b>wcb</b> → <code>with-current-buffer</code>
</li>
<li><b>efn</b> → <code>expand-file-name</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's pointless to list all of them here, there are 136 of them at the moment.
The whole purpose of these abbrevs is that you don't need to learn them. Instead
of typing <code>insert SPC</code> or maybe <code>ins TAB</code>, you just write <code>i SPC</code> for the same
effect. You'll be surprised how quickly this abbreviations become more natural
to you than the actual names.
</p>

<p>
And before you start worrying, these are defined in a way such that they <i>only</i>
expand in a place where you would use a function. So hitting <kbd>SPC</kbd> after <code>(r</code>
gives <code>(require '</code>, but hitting <kbd>SPC</kbd> after <code>(delete-region r</code> will <i>not</i> expand
the <code>r</code>, because that's obviously not a function. You can safely use short
variable names without running into conflicts.
</p>

<p>
You may I have noticed I've only mentioned functions. Variable abbrevs are
on the way!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Speedy keybinds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It also defines 4 commands, which fit tightly into this <i>“follow the
thought-flow”</i> way of writing.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <kbd>M-RET</kbd> </dt><dd>Break line and insert <code>()</code> with point in the middle.
</dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-RET</kbd> </dt><dd>Do <code>forward-up-list</code> then do the above.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Hitting <kbd>RET</kbd> followed by a <kbd>(</kbd> was one of the most common key sequences for me
while writing elisp, so giving it a quick-to-hit key is a significant
improvement.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> <kbd>C-c f</kbd> </dt><dd>Find function under point. If it is not defined, create a
definition for it above the current function and leave point
inside.
</dd>
<dt> <kbd>C-c v</kbd> </dt><dd>Same, but for variable.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
With these commands, you just write your code as you think of it. Once you hit a
“stop-point” of sorts in your thought-flow, you hit <kbd>C-c v</kbd> on any undefined
variables. Then you just write its definition, and hit <kbd>C-u C-SPC</kbd>
(<a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/pop-global-mark"><code>pop-global-mark</code></a>) to go back to where you were.

<h2 id="sec-3">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
<code>sotlisp</code> is floating around the Elpas, so you can issue the usual <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<code>package-install</code> <kbd>RET</kbd> <code>sotlisp</code>, and activate it in your init file.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(speed-of-thought-mode)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Then you'll be able to do magic such as writing 
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert text)
  (buffer-string))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
by typing <code>(wtb</code> <kbd>M-RET</kbd> <code>i</code> <kbd>SPC</kbd> <code>text</code> <kbd>C-RET</kbd> <code>bs</code> <kbd>SPC</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Also coming up is a <code>sotlatex</code> package and perhaps even a <code>sotclojure</code>.
