<a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">Expand region</a> is one of those packages that deserves to be built-in. It's so
simple and useful it makes Emacs worthwhile all by itself. Fundamentally, the
entire package boils down to a single command, <code>expand-region</code>, which
incrementally increases the selected region by semantic units. So deciding where
to bind this command is an important decision.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">The Readme</a> suggests <kbd>C-=</kbd> and I've seen recurring recommendations for <kbd>S-SPC</kbd>,
which I used for a while, but neither felt quite right for me. After marking a
small region, the most common operation for me is to copy it, but it's very
awkward for my fingers to hit <kbd>S-SPC</kbd> <kbd>M-w</kbd>. With that in mind, in one of my
brightest epiphanies, I defined the following keybind.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(global-set-key (kbd "M-2") #'er/expand-region)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Not only does <kbd>M-2</kbd> use the same modifier as <kbd>M-w</kbd>, but it's right above the
latter. I couldn't hope for a better key. Besides, after years of switching tabs
in Firefox, my fingers are sniper rifles when it comes to hitting <kbd>M-2</kbd>, making
this combo extra speedy. The downside is that you forgo using Meta for prefix
arguments, but <a href="/Meta-Binds-Part-1%253A-Drunk-in-the-Dark.html">I'm fine with that</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I select large regions, I'm probably killing instead of copying. While
<kbd>M-2</kbd> <kbd>C-w</kbd> is not terribly natural, it's also not awkward, so the key is good
enough here. Finally, <kbd>M-2</kbd> also fits well with my <code>multiple-cursors</code> keybinds,
but that's a topic for another post.
