<p>
Following yesterday’s list of the <a href="/sweet-new-features-in-24-4.html">Sweetest New Features in 24.4</a>, today
I go through the ones that strike me as most useful, either to me or to
the Emacs environment itself. This is the part where I had to cut the
most. Emacs 24.4 exhibits a downpour of usability improvements, and it
almost feels unjust to not list them all. Nonetheless, I’ve narrowed
them down to 8.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The commands <code>eval-expression</code> (<code>M-:</code>), <code>eval-last-sexp</code> (<code>C-x C-e</code>),
and <code>eval-print-last-sexp</code> (<code>C-j</code> in Lisp Interaction mode) can take a
zero prefix argument.  This disables truncation of lists in the output,
equivalent to setting <code>(eval-expression-)print-length</code> and
<code>(eval-expression-)print-level</code> to nil.  Additionally, it causes integers
to be printed in other formats (octal, hexadecimal, and character).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Fantastic! The default behaviour of truncating lists proves frustrating
every so often. My solution had been to set <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/print-length"><code>print-length</code></a> to nil, but
that’s also not ideal as you don’t always want to see everything either.
</p>

<p>
Being able to quickly toggle between the two is just perfect.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>electric-indent-mode</code> is now enabled by default.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
New buffer-local <code>electric-indent-local-mode</code>. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I personally have fallen in love with <a href="/permanent-auto-indentation.html">Aggressive Auto-indentation</a>, but
this is a smart and convenient default. Also, see Bozhidar’s <a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/01/19/a-peek-at-emacs-24-dot-4-auto-indentation-by-default/">Emacs
Redux post</a> on this feature.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New hooks <code>focus-in-hook</code>, <code>focus-out-hook</code>. These are normal hooks run when an Emacs frame gains or loses input focus.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/521/turn-off-jabber-notifications-when-emacs-has-focus">already</a> <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/265/how-to-auto-save-buffers-when-emacs-loses-focus">two</a> questions on <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">Emacs.StackExchange</a> which are
solved by these hooks! And I expect they’ll pull their weight for a
long time still.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Uniquify is enabled by default
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This doesn’t really affect me, as <a href="https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/smart-mode-line/">smart-mode-line</a> has its own way of
uniquifying names, but it’s a huge improvement over the old numbering
system.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
letf is now just an alias for cl-letf.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I shouldn’t have to tell you <a href="/understanding-letf-and-how-it-replaces-flet.html">why this is a big deal</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New Dired minor mode <code>dired-hide-details-mode</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This used to be a very popular third party extension for dired. It’s
always nice to see good ideas getting promoted to built-in.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
More packages look for ~/.emacs.d/&lt;foo&gt; additionally to ~/.&lt;foo&gt;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I won’t list each of the affected files here, suffice to say that they
add up to 17 and include some very popular packages, such as <code>places</code>
and <code>ido</code>. You could always do this yourself by configuring a score of
different variables, but it’s nice to see Emacs taking initiative
against home clutter.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New macro <code>define-alternatives</code> can be used to define generic commands.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I had to write up some code to see what this was about and it
certainly peaked my interest. <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/define-alternatives"><code>define-alternatives</code></a> is a command which
defines a function with several possible implementations. The user is
then asked to choose the implementation he prefers upon invoking the command
for the first time.
</p>

<p>
For instance, say I’m writing up a major-mode for the Julia language.
I want to offer a compilation command, but I don’t known whether the
user will prefer synchronous or asynchronous compilation. So I use
define alternatives.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-alternatives julia-mode-compile
  ;; These keywords are used on the defcustom
  ;; for `julia-mode-compile-alternatives'.
  :group julia-mode
  :version "1.0")

(setq julia-mode-compile-alternatives
      '(("Compile synchronously" . 
         julia-mode-compile-synchronously)
        ("Compile asynchronously" . 
         julia-mode-compile-asynchronously)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The first time the user invokes <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<code>julia-mode-compile</code>, they will be asked to choose an implementation.
</p>
