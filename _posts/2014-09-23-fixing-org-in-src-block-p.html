<p>
For reasons which ellude me, the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-in-src-block-p"><code>org-in-src-block-p</code></a> function is
disappointingly inconsistent for me. Given its major role in
<a href="/emacs-narrow-or-widen-dwim.html">narrow-or-widen-dwim</a>, this frequently led to <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-edit-src-code"><code>org-edit-src-code</code></a> not
getting called when point was inside a code block.
</p>

<p>
I’ve edited the <a href="/emacs-narrow-or-widen-dwim.html">narrow-or-widen-dwim</a> to not need that function. Go
copy it again if you were using it.
