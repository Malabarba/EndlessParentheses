Thanks to Nicolas Petton, Emacs is getting a new built-in sequence library in
25.1, and it’s already <a href="http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/seq.html">available on GNU Elpa</a> for everyone. There’s not much to
be said about this besides the obvious <i>“it’s about time”</i>. 
</p>

<p>
The popularity of <a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">dash.el</a> speaks volumes about the need for this feature.
Combined with the recent inclusion of <code>if-let</code>, <code>when-let</code>, and the threading
macros into Emacs core, this should eventually allow most packages to phase out
that extra dependency. Not that there’s anything wrong with <code>dash</code>, of course,
but it’s nice to retire an external dependency if a built-in one becomes
available.
</p>

<p>
Still, in the field of sequence-processing, there are some noteworthy
differences that may lead you to prefer one over the other.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>seq</code> provides a unified interface for lists, vectors, and strings (i.e.,
sequences).
</li>
<li>Some functions take arguments in a different order, such as <code>(-take n list)</code>
  versus <code>(seq-take list n)</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Are there any operations you feel ought to be added to this arsenal? What about
other utility libraries that really should be built-in?

    This post used to say that “<code>dash</code> still covers a range of operations that <code>seq</code>
    doesn’t”. However, Nico seems very intent on <a href="http://disq.us/8n45jb">proving me wrong</a>, and we now have
    <code>seq-difference</code> and <code>seq-intersection</code>.
