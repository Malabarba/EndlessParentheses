<p>
Another library by the productive Nicolas Petton. <code>map.el</code> is a cousin to
<code>seq.el</code> (<a href="/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-seq-el.html">remember?</a>), but instead of manipulating plain sequences, it
manipulates map-like collections (also known as dictionaries).
</p>

<p>
The range of functions should include everything you expect, from <code>map-values</code>
and <code>map-keys</code> to get a list of the values and keys (duh), to general getters
and setters like <code>map-elt</code> and <code>map-put</code>. Inside it, you’ll even find some
fancier stuff like <code>map-let</code>, <code>map-values-apply</code>, or <code>map-nested-elt</code>. For those
who know what that means, it also comes with a <code>pcase</code> macro!
</p>

<p>
Note that this library does <b>not</b> introduce a new data structure. It simply
provides a consistent and unified API for dealing with any map-like structure
you need. This applies to alists, hash-maps, and even vectors (it treats the
vector as a dictionary whose keys are all integers).</p>
