Our final post of the series starts with a sober note, but swiftly
moves to a happy ending. Just as we cherish each improvement to our
favorite packages, so must we honor the dead who served us and give
the newborn a chance to thrive. These are the packages marked
obsolete, followed by the new packages you didn’t even know you wanted.

First, some short comments on the obituary.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
longlines.el; use visual-line-mode.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="/longlines-mode-in-latex.html">This is sad</a>, but don’t weep yet. I have a feeling a dead will rise
from this grave on Emacs 25 (stay tuned).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
iswitchb.el; use icomplete-mode.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This news flowed around the Emacsphere some months ago. Between
<code>icomplete-mode</code> and <code>ido-mode</code>, <code>iswitchb</code> was no longer necessary. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
terminal.el; use term.el instead.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They were redundant, and now they’re identical.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
meese.el.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
sup-mouse.el.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
the old version of todo-mode.el (renamed to otodo-mode.el).
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
xesam.el (owing to the cancellation of the XESAM project).
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
yow.el; use fortune.el or cookie1.el instead.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Five packages I’ve never ever ever heard of. But I’m sure somebody
will miss them.

Now, the interesting part.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New package eww.el provides a built-in web browser.
This requires Emacs to have been compiled with libxml2 support.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I remember a lot of talk on <code>eww</code>’s speed and visual accuracy. It’s
not always that I salute a package whose role is already filled by
several others, but this one looks promising.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New package nadvice.el offers lighter-weight advice facilities.
It is layered as:<br  />
<code>add-function</code> and <code>remove-function</code>, which can be used to add/remove code on
any function-carrying place, such as process filters or <code>&lt;foo&gt;-function</code> hooks.<br  />
<code>advice-add</code> and <code>advice-remove</code> to add/remove a piece of advice on a named
function, much like <code>defadvice</code> does.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the advice interface needed a light-weight alternative. I
never really noticed, and this package (while nice) feels rather
underwhelming. Here’s a usage example.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defvar x 1)
(defun test ()
  "Description"
  (interactive)
  (message "%s" x))

(advice-add 
 'test :around
 (lambda (fun) 
   (let ((x 2))
     (funcall fun))))
{% endhighlight %}

<blockquote>
<p>
New package frameset.el provides a set of operations to save a frameset
(the state of all or a subset of the existing frames and windows, somewhat
similar to a frame configuration), both in-session and persistently, and
restore it at some point in the future.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now we’re talking! Can you believe Emacs had no way of saving
window/frame configurations between sessions? I ran into this problem
before, and so did <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/822/50">this user at Emacs.SO</a>. Before, all you could do was
save it within a single session.
Thanks to <code>frameset.el</code>, not only can you save configurations
manually, but <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/desktop-save-mode"><code>desktop-save-mode</code></a> hooks into that automatically!
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New package filenotify.el provides an interface for file system
notifications.  It requires that Emacs be compiled with one of the
low-level libraries gfilenotify.c, inotify.c or w32notify.c.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I can imagine some nice uses for this, but we’ll have to see what
comes of it. For what it’s worth, <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/auto-revert-mode"><code>auto-revert-mode</code></a> already makes use
of this interface when it’s available, making it much less demanding.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New minor mode <code>superword-mode</code>, which overrides the default word motion
commands to treat "symbol_words" as a single word, similar to what
<code>subword-mode</code> does.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bozhidar <a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/08/27/a-peek-at-emacs-24-dot-4-superword-mode/">has more to say on this</a> than I do. I’m a <code>subword-mode</code>
worshipper, so I won’t be using this mode.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
New minor modes <code>prettify-symbols-mode</code> and <code>global-prettify-symbols-mode</code>
display specified symbols as composed characters.  E.g., in Emacs Lisp mode,
this replaces the string "lambda" with the Greek lambda character.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And we go off with a bang! By default, in <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>, this will
only turn <code>lambda</code> into <code>λ</code>, but that’s enough reason to turn it on.
