Any Emacs package developer worth their salt knows the difference between a
<a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/defvar"><code>defvar</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/defcustom"><code>defcustom</code></a>. These two comprise the vast majority of variable
definitions in Elisp code, but there's a third child, the <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/defconst"><code>defconst</code></a>. While
regular variables and customizable variables only really differ when it comes to
Emacs' <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/customize"><code>customize</code></a> system, constants differ in loading logic in a subtle but
important way.
</p>

<p>
When a <code>defvar</code> is evaluated, the value specified is assigned to the variable
only if the previous value was void (if the variable wasn't defined yet).
Evaluating a <code>defconst</code>, on the other hand, <i>always</i> sets the symbol's value to
the (new) given value. This becomes most relevant when a package is upgraded
<i>after</i> having been loaded in Emacs. Any variables defined by the package will
retain their old values until Emacs is restarted, whereas constants will be
updated to their new values.
</p>

<p>
In a sense, somewhat ironically, Elisp constants are the least constant of all
variables. Rest assured though, they were given this name for a reason. This
behaviour is indeed suited for storing values that should be constant. Here's a
simple use-case which arose for us in <a href="https://github.com/vermiculus/sx.el#readme">sx.el</a>.
</p>

<p>
The StackExchange API requires that we provide filters to specify which
information we want to receive. Of course, we were storing these filters in
variables and then using that information while printing the question.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defvar sx-browse-filter
  '(question.title question.owner))

(defun sx-question--print-info (question-data)
  (let-alist question-data
    .title "\nAsked by:" .owner))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The problem with this approach would only be seen after an upgrade. Lets say we
decide to also display a question's score. Without a doubt, we'd change the
above to something like this.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defvar sx-browse-filter
  '(question.score question.title question.owner))

(defun sx-question--print-info (question-data)
  (let-alist question-data
    (number-to-string .score) " "
    .title "\nAsked by:" .owner))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now the user upgrades <code>sx.el</code>, tries to run it again, and gets hit on the face
with an error! 
</p>

<p>
<code>sx-browse-filter</code> is still using the old value, so the question score is not
returned by the API. That means <code>.score</code> is nil and <code>number-to-string</code> throws an
error. Changing the <code>defvar</code> to <code>defconst</code> was all we needed to prevent this
problem.
</p>

<p>
If you're wondering why you've never run into such an issue, that's because
<code>package.el</code> used to have another bug, which would never load new package
versions upon upgrade. That has been fixed in 25.1&#x2014;packages are now reloaded
on upgrade&#x2014;so you should ensure your package won't run into new problems by
making proper use of constants.
</p>

<p>
Simply put, you should <code>defconst</code> whenever there are functions or macros in a
package which rely on the variable having that specific value (kind of like a
proper constant). This way you'll know you never have old values hanging around.
