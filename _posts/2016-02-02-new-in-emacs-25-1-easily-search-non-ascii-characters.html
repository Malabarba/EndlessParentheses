<p>
Since <a href="/new-in-emacs-25-1-round-quotes-in-help-buffers.html">last week’s post</a> was about Unicode characters, it makes sense to continue
that trend today. This feature might go unnoticed by a lot of people who live in
an ASCII world, but it will probably jump out at everyone else at one point or
another. The name, if a bit odd, is “character-folding search”.
</p>

<p>
In Emacs 25, Isearch can find a wide range of Unicode characters (like á, ⓐ, or
𝒶) when you search for ASCII characters (<code>a</code> in this example). To enable this
feature, set the variable <code>search-default-mode</code> to <code>char-fold-to-regexp</code>.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(setq search-default-mode #'char-fold-to-regexp)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This first came up due to a new feature of a recent version of Texinfo, where
some markup styles are exported in “round quotes” when generating the info
manual. This is a nice improvement in readability, but when you’re trying to
search for something with <kbd>C-s</kbd>, things can get a little difficult if your
keyboard can’t type some of the characters.
</p>

<p>
With char-folding, when you hit <kbd>C-s</kbd> and search for ", Emacs will also search
for a variety of double quotes, from the aforementioned “” to many others like
«» and ❝❞. The same goes for the single quote, and for pretty much any other
ASCII character.
</p>

<p>
You could always type any Unicode character by name with <kbd>C-x 8 RET</kbd>, and many
of them even have their own shortcuts under <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>, but not <i>having</i> to type
them can be a significant convenience when it comes up. As any Brazilian, I am a
daily user of diacritical marks (ó, ã, ê, and the likes), and even though my
keyboard <i>can</i> type these characters, I still enjoy the simplicity of not having
to.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can extend this feature to the <code>query-replace</code> command, which is
also as easy as setting a variable.
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(setq replace-char-fold t)
{% endhighlight %}
