<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/">Paradox</a> has had this feature 
for a while, but I've never blogged about it. When you're in the Packages Menu, and you're about to upgrade your
packages with the always reliable <kbd>U x</kbd>, do you ever wonder what's actually
changed in them? When I do it, there's usually something between 5 and 20 of
them just waiting for me to answer <kbd>y</kbd>, but rarely do I see any actual
difference in the new versions.
</p>

<p>
With Paradox you can find out what's been happening to a package, by listing all
of its commits that happened since the version you have installed. Of course,
this isn't a proper Change-Log &#x2014;for starters, it's a lot noisier&#x2014; but since
most packages don't have one, this is the closest thing we have.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Open the menu as usual with <code>paradox-list-packages</code> (which really ought to be
in your <a href="/launcher-keymap-for-standalone-features.html">launcher map</a>).
</li>
<li>Hit <kbd>f u</kbd> to filter by upgradeable packages (did you know you could do that,
by the way?).
</li>
<li>Hit <kbd>l</kbd> on any package to list the commits.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here's an example of what you might see.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/images/paradox-commit-list.png" alt="paradox-commit-list.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note how the first three commits are highlighted. These are the ones I'm about
to install. It even tells me there a comments discussing one of them, so I might
want to have a closer look. Hitting <kbd>RET</kbd> on a line will visit the relevant
commit on Github.
</p>

<p>
As you may have guessed, this only applies to packages on Github. But, at this
point, that's where most of them are.</p>
