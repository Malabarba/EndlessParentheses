<p>
<code>hungry-delete-mode</code> is what I like to call a <i>“free feature”</i> &#x2014;it
asks nothing of you. In contrast, most other worthwhile features
charge you a price. The cheapest novelties charge some mental effort on
your part to fit into your workflow, the moderate ones ask for some space on
your ever-diminishing set of free keys, and a few narcisistic gems demand
that you adopt a completely new state of mind (paredit, I'm looking at you).
</p>

<p>
<code>hungry-delete-mode</code> doesn't steal a key and takes absolutely no
effort to master. It isn't big and flashy, but it is one of the
features I miss the <b>most</b> when I'm not in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Plain and simple, it makes <kbd>backspace</kbd> and
<kbd>C-d</kbd> erase <i>all</i> consecutive white space in a given
direction (instead of just one). Use it everywhere.
