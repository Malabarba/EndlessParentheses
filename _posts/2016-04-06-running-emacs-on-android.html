As Android phones rise in power, bluetooth keyboards become cheaper, and your
addiction to Emacs grows, it’s only natural that you start thinking of combining
the three. Fortunately for you, it’s not as hard as it used to be. In fact, it’s
perfectly possible to reproduce (most of) your desktop config, if you know how
to get past a few obstacles.
</p>

<p>
I was going to precede these instructions with a short tale, but I got a little
carried a way and it grew a little too large. Because of that, I’ll give you
the instructions first and let you decide whether to read my self-indulgent
delusions below.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a> (and optionally <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard">Hacker’s keyboard</a>) from the Play store.</li>
<li><p>
Start it, and run:
</p>
{% highlight sh %}
apt update
apt install emacs
{% endhighlight %}</li>
<li>Copy your desktop’s <code>init.el</code> file to your phone (read below for a way to
keep it synchronized).</li>
<li>Run <code>emacs -q</code> (celebrate a little!) and visit the init file for editing.</li>
<li><p>
Add this to the init file:
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq temporary-file-directory "~/tmp/")
{% endhighlight %}</li>
<li>If the init file contains <code>(server-start)</code>, wrap it in a 
<code>(ignore-errors ...)</code>.</li>
<li>Close Emacs, and start it normally this time (no <code>-q</code>).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If Emacs spits a “void-function &#x2026;” error at you, comment out the relevant
part of your init file and try again. See below for the explanation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Celebrate a lot!</li>
</ol>

<p>
I was surprised how well this worked in the end. Even <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon">Beacon</a>, which is a largely
graphical package, worked pretty well.

Last night, in a fit of boredom, far away from my laptop and from any physical
keyboard, I did what any reasonable person would have done: decided to install
Emacs on my phone. My last attempt at crossing this bridge was over a year ago,
and resulted in nothing but absolute failure. Still&#x2026; Something felt different
this time. Something felt right.
</p>

<p>
My first stop was an obvious one. There’s an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zielm.emacs">Emacs app</a> on the play store
claiming to do exactly what I needed. On my previous attempts, this app had
given inconsistent results, crashing more often than running. This time,
however, it wouldn’t even install. The Play Store just greeted me with a
“Failure to install” error instead.
</p>

<p>
Not all was lost, though. A <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zielm.emacs&amp;reviewId=Z3A6QU9xcFRPSGQ2WG1fR1M3MlhacU13MmtWd2NlaGpza1k0czVkaVlVUm85QThiZ3V6RjRNQWU2bUFTcE0yWWVzM3VheG1ERkYxOVctbnhfWVJBeUZsc0E">generous comment</a> (with an less-than-generous rating)
points me in a new direction.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a>, my beacon of hope, is a robust app that claims to offer “powerful
terminal emulation with an extensive Linux package collection”. After installing
it, I am indeed greeted with a terminal emulator, but I’m not impressed. I’ve
used terminal apps before. Tentatively, I run the commands (as instructed by the
man-from-the-review).
</p>

{% highlight sh %}
apt update
apt install emacs
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/termux-emacs.png"><img src="/images/termux-emacs.png" alt="termux-emacs.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Surprisingly, it played out even better than expected. Installing Emacs would
have been fine, but installing version 25 is exceptional! My init file is sure
to be incompatible with Emacs 24, but now that we have 25&#x2026; Dare I even hope?
Could I reproduce my entire setup on this minute device?
</p>

<p>
Before proceeding, I hopped back over to the play store and installed the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard">Hacker’s keyboard</a>, to get access to modifier keys. Then, starting <code>emacs</code> from the
terminal worked as expected, if a bit slowly, but my streak of good fortune was
about to end. 
</p>

<p>
The first command I issued <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>list-packages</code> failed with a cryptic message
about nonexistent file in <code>/tmp/asdlij198h1</code>. The package menu displayed, but
refused to refresh. So I <kbd>C-z</kbd> out of Emacs, and try <code>mkdir /tmp/</code>.
</p>
{% highlight text %}
Permission denied
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Ok, I should have expected that. <code>sudo</code> doesn’t work either, so I issue <code>fg</code> to
go back to Emacs and try a different approach.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(setq temporary-file-directory "~/tmp/")
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now <code>list-packages</code> again, and it works! I try to install <code>company</code> from the
<code>gnu</code> repository, and it works too! In fact, everything works. I run <kbd>M-x</kbd>
<code>global-company-mode</code> and it’s all there, popup menu and everything.
</p>

<p>
At this point I’m probably way more satisfied with myself than I should for such
a senseless pursuit, but I’m too high to realize. 
</p>

<p>
Next step is to port over my real init file. Fortunately, I keep it sync’d via
Dropbox, so it’s easy to make available on the phone. Just open the Dropbox app,
find my <code>init.el</code>, and mark it to be “Available offline”. Same thing for my
<code>init.org</code>. Dropbox saves the files somewhere deep inside its own data
directory, and automatically syncs them up when you make local changes (though
you have to manually ask it to pull down remote changes).
</p>

<p>
Back on Termux, I send Emacs to the background again with <kbd>C-z</kbd>, and 
</p>
{% highlight sh %}
cd ~/.emacs.d
ln -s /sdcard/Android/data/com.dropbox.android/files/SOME_GIBBERISH/.emacs.d/init.el
ln -s /sdcard/Android/data/com.dropbox.android/files/SOME_GIBBERISH/.emacs.d/init.org
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Actually finding the file took a bit of trial and error. After getting to the
<code>files</code> directory I had to tab-complete my way through several gibberish
directory names before finding the right one. <code>fg</code> and we’re back in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
The next obstacle are the packages. I know my init file is not going to load
before I install the necessary packages. Sadly, I didn’t never had the foresight
of rewriting my configuration in something like <code>use-package</code>, but there’s
something almost as good. Like I’ve mentioned before, Emacs 25
<a href="/new-in-package-el-in-emacs-25-1-user-selected-packages.html">keeps track of user-selected packages</a>, so I was able to go into my
<code>custom-set-variables</code> and find a sizeable list under
<code>package-selected-packages</code>. With no further ceremony, I just evaluate the whole
thing with <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>, and issue <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>package-install-selected-packages</code>.
</p>

<p>
This takes a while&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
This is a good moment to find out if Termux works well in the background. Switch
to the Youtube app, watch a couple of videos, switch back&#x2026; And it worked!
</p>

<p>
This is it now &#x2014; the moment of truth. I’m still feeling high and mighty after
all this success, but I have to respect the odds. My init file has 4 thousand
lines of Elisp and involves over 100 packages. That’s a whole lot of
could-go-wrong potential. 
</p>

<p>
I take a deep breath and mentally try to lower my expectations. I <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> back
to the terminal, and then carefully type <code>emacs</code> followed by <kbd>↵</kbd>, only to plunge
head-first into an error. 
</p>

<p>
Something about the <code>tmp</code> directory again. Haven’t I solved this one? A bit more
digging reveals it’s being triggered by <code>(server-start)</code>, because
<code>server-socket-dir</code> is bound to ~"/tmp/emacs1000"~. The comments above the
variable explain why.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;; We do not use `temporary-file-directory' here,
;; because emacsclient does not read the init file.
(defvar server-socket-dir
  ...)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
That’s understandable, but it doesn’t help me. Impatiently, I just wrap the call
to <code>server-start</code> in <code>ignore-errors</code> and try again&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Another error. This time it’s complaining that <code>set-fringe-mode</code> is a void
function. That’s a lot easier to understand. The Emacs binary provided in Termux
is compiled for terminal (why wouldn’t it be?), so many graphical functions
aren’t defined at all. It’s also easy to solve. Just add a conditional around
the function call.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(when (fboundp 'set-fringe-mode)
  (set-fringe-mode '(nil . 0)))
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
A third time. <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> <code>emacs</code> <kbd>↵</kbd>&#x2026; And it works! No more errors. Not even a
warning! My beloved <code>darktooth</code> theme is unrecognizable, but all the other
indicative signs of my Emacs setup are there. <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line">Smart-mode-line</a> discretely smiles
at me from the bottom of the screen. <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon/">Beacon</a> eagerly blinks at me as soon as I
start scrolling. And the unmistakable coziness of my personal keybinds reach me
even through the limited interface of a touchscreen-keyboard.
</p>

<p>
As we get to this point, a lesser person might feel an anticlimax &#x2014; a hint of
of a “what for?”, perhaps. But not me. I just feel safe and reassured, knowing
that, wherever I am and whenever I need it, Emacs will always be sitting in my
pocket.
</p>

<p>
Now I just need to get myself one of those bluetooth keyboards I mentioned&#x2026;
