<p>
Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been working on a Clojure debugger for <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">Cider</a>
that is strongly inspired by Edebug. Stepping trough code of any form and
injecting values into running code are the features available in this first
release.
</p>

<p>
This little project started shortly after I my first practical delve into
Clojure. I was impressed at how well Cider integrated Clojure into Emacs, it
almost felt like writing Elisp! When <a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov/status/574112622167068672">Bozhidar mentioned</a> that they were in need
of a debugger, I figured that would be as a good a chance as any to practice some
Clojure. Since my praise for Edebug <a href="/debugging-emacs-lisp-part-1-earn-your-independence.html">is no secret</a> around here, it should come as
no surprise that I’d model <code>cider-debug</code> after it (albeit, a bit more limited).
</p>

<p>
I should also mention the <a href="https://github.com/razum2um/clj-debugger">clj-debugger</a> plugin, which we don’t use anymore but
was a great help while writing this feature.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Usage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
First, if you’re still using <code>cider</code> 0.8, you’ll need to upgrade to the latest
stable version <a href="http://stable.melpa.org/#/cider"><code>cider</code> 0.9</a>, which is available on Melpa. Additionally, ensure
your “~/.lein/profiles.clj” file is consistent with that.
</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.9.0"]]}}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Once that is done, using <code>cider-debug</code> could hardly be more straightforward.
Just instrument an expression with <kbd>C-u C-M-x</kbd>, and you’ll be taken through the
code step-by-step. There, you can move on with <kbd>n</kbd>, quit with <kbd>q</kbd>, or inject
values with <kbd>i</kbd>. Note that if you instrument a <code>defn</code> the debugger will not
start immediately, instead, you’ll be taken to the debugger each time the
function is executed.
</p>

<p>
This sort of thing is easier to explain with a gif.

We’d very much appreciate the feedback of any Clojurists out there. <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues">File an
issue</a> if you spot something, or just share your thoughts with us on <a href="http://twitter.com/AMalabarba">Twitter</a> or
<a href="https://gitter.im/clojure-emacs/cider">Gitter</a>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2015-06-16 Tue&gt;</span></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
That screen-cast above is a little outdated now. Since it was recorded, the
debugger has acquired <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#cider-debug">even more features</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>listing local variables,
</li>
<li>evaluating code in the current lexical scope,
</li>
<li>injecting values into the code,
</li>
<li>a move-out command similar to Edebug.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’ll make another post eventually, but it’s perfectly intuitive and easy to use.
So give it a try yourself if you use cider.
