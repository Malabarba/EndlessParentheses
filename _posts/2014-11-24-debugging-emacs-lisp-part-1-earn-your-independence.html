<p>
Running into errors is not only a consequence of tinkering with your
editor, it is the <i>only</i> road to graduating in Emacs. Therefore, it
stands to reason that Emacs would contain the most impressive
debugging utilities know to mankind, <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Using-Edebug.html">Edebug</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Learning to Edebug is the right decision for anyone who doesn't know
how to Edebug. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's easy as pie, you have no excuse not to learn it.
</li>
<li>It helps you solve your own problems. Not that the community isn't
helpful, it just allows you to help yourself&#x2014;which will eventually
allow you to help the community.
</li>
<li>If you're a newcomer, it will teach you more about elisp than most
tutorials out there.
</li>
<li>If you're anything other than a newcomer, then it's about time and
you should be ashamed of yourself.
</li>
</ul>

Before delving into Edebug, you should be aware of <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/toggle-debug-on-error"><code>toggle-debug-on-error</code></a> and
<a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/toggle-debug-on-quit"><code>toggle-debug-on-quit</code></a> (which happen to be in our <a href="/the-toggle-map-and-wizardry.html">toggle-map</a>). Though not as
powerful as the alternative, they're a quick n' dirty way to get a backtrace of
your problem.

<h2 id="sec-2">How to Edebug a function</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go to where the function is defined. You can usually do that with
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> (which calls describe function) or just
<kbd>M-x find-function</kbd>.
</li>
<li>Press <kbd>C-u C-M-x</kbd>. This turns on Edebug for that function.
</li>
<li>Now, just invoke the function (or some other command that calls
that function). 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The next time the Edebugged function gets called, Emacs will display
its source code and will take you through it step-by-step. Press
<kbd>n</kbd> to continue to the next step or
<kbd>c</kbd> to stop fooling around and skip to the end.
</p>

<p>
For instance, to solve the <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox/issues/15">issue that lead me to write this</a>, we could
perform the following sequence of commands:
</p>

{% highlight text %}
M-x find-function RET package-menu--generate RET
C-u C-M-x
M-x paradox-list-packages RET
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Once a function has been instrumented, it will trigger Edebug <i>every time</i> it is
called. To undo this effect (to remove instrumentation) simply visit its
definition again and hit <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> without the prefix.q
