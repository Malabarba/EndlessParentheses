<p>
Link handling and exporting is one of the most versatile aspects of org-mode.
Did you know you can make org-mode understand Markdown style link IDs?
</p>

<p>
You should already know <a href="/use-org-mode-links-for-absolutely-anything.html">org-links can do absolutely anything</a>, but it takes a
little creativity to know how to apply that. <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/594/50">Here's the question</a> by Kaushal that
prompted this over at <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/">Emacs.StackExchange</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At times, I need to use the same link at multiple places in a long document. For
those cases it would be useful to have link IDs like in markdown. 
</p>
{% highlight text %}
This is [an example][some-id] reference-style link. 
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:
</p>
{% highlight text %}
 [some-id]: http://example.com/
{% endhighlight %}
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/599/50">The solution</a> I came up with defines three different functions, so I’ll let you
follow the link instead of clogging up this blog post. The result is that you
can define link IDs like this anywhere in your document (probably the top or the
bottom).
</p>
{% highlight text %}
#+LINK-ID: wiki http://www.emacswiki.org
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And then you can use that URL in links throughout the document by writing them
like this.
</p>
{% highlight text %}
Here is a [[lid:wiki][wiki link]], and here 
is [[lid:wiki][another one]].
{% endhighlight %}
