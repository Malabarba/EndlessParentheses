You're not a true Emacs package developer until you run
<a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/checkdoc"><code>checkdoc</code></a> through your packages. You'll be amazed at the
number of style errors it finds. Unfortunately, not enough
adepts are aware of this tool, perhaps because it's more of
an icing spatula than a carving knife.
</p>

<p>
Just visit your package file and run <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>checkdoc</code>.
</p>

<p>
It runs through the buffer and pinpoints style and spelling
errors in your docstrings and comments. It won't change the
taste of your chocolate cake, but it will give the icing
that lovely silky smoothness.

As Grant Retke and lunaryorn were kind to point out in the comments,
