<p>
When this blog was conceived, I decided that I wanted it to be entirely
contained in a single org file, and that this would also be my Emacs init file.
On the blog’s <a href="/init-org-Without-org-mode.html">very first post</a> I explained how to implement the latter, an init
file that also serves other purposes. Today, Endless Parentheses turns 1 year
old, and it’s time to explain the former, how to turn a file into a blog.
</p>

<p>
As is usually the case with first birthdays, the child has no clue of what’s
going on, and it’s really just an excuse to indulge the parents into praising
themselves for keeping the kid alive 12 whole months. As such, this will not be
a productive post. Expect no code snippets, no Emacs news, and no productivity
tips, as I release myself from my usual shackles and go off on a tangent for a
change. Still, just in case someone else likes the idea, I’ve <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/ox-jekyll-subtree">pushed the code</a> to
Github.
</p>

<p>
Before anything else, it should go without saying that the content of the posts
is written in <code>org-mode</code>. The engine I use for exporting is a large wrapper
around <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress/blob/master/ox-jekyll.el">ox-jekyll</a>, and the posts are all pushed to Github and rendered by their
built-in Jekyll support.

First of all because org, once you learn its knobs and bobs, is just plain
powerful. This is all the more true because the post contents are also in org
format, so you’re effectively removing one layer of distance between you and the
content. For example, if I want to reschedule a post, I just find it with <kbd>C-c
C-j</kbd> and hit <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>; whereas, if the posts were separate files, I’d have to
find it in <code>dired</code>, then visit it, and <i>then</i> hit <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>. 
</p>

<p>
This is a small difference, but it applies all around. If I want to link to a
previous post, I find it with <kbd>C-c C-j</kbd> and then move back with <kbd>C-u C-SPC</kbd>, all
without leaving the buffer. When I look at the posts list, the tags are listed
right beside the title, I don’t have to open a file to see them.
</p>

<p>
Now let me be honest with you. I didn’t predict these advantages before I
started the blog, so it’s not why I chose this approach. Rather, it was linked
to the fact that I wanted to blog about all these elisp snippets I had built
over years and accumulated in my init file.
</p>

<p>
You see, if posts were separate files I would have to copy the snippets to a
separate org file, and then write about them there, and <i>then</i> export them to
Jekyll. In this scenario, I just know I would eventually change some snippet (a
healthy init file is a fluid creature) and forget to update the corresponding
org file, and the thought of leaving out-dated code lying around sent a chill
through my spine. Not to mention, this whole flow of “init file → org post →
jekyll post” has one layer too many for my taste, and redundancy is an evil I
slay with a chainsaw.

<h2 id="sec-2">How it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
First of all, here’s what I see when Emacs starts up.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/init-org-1.png"><img src="/images/init-org-1.png" alt="init-org-1.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If you read (and remember) the <a href="/init-org-Without-org-mode.html">first post</a>, you’ll know that the actual init file
is composed of code blocks inside that <code>init.el</code> headline. Everything else is
text. Also, notice that last <code>SEQ_TODO</code> header. It specifies that headlines in
this file have three possible <code>TODO</code> states, <code>TODO</code>, <code>READY</code> and <code>DONE</code>.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/init-org-meta-binds.png"><img src="/images/init-org-meta-binds.png" alt="init-org-meta-binds.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Every post is marked with one of these states, and that is what defines them.
<code>TODO</code> is something I plan on writing about; <code>READY</code> is, well, ready to publish;
and <code>DONE</code> is published.
</p>

<p>
This three-states setup has several uses, mainly:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can review my entire history and my future schedule with a <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/680/50">custom agenda
command</a>, leveraging all the features of <code>org-agenda</code>.
</li>
<li>Whenever I change a snippet, and the headline above it is marked <code>DONE</code>, I’m
immediately reminded to update the post (as simple as <kbd>C-c b</kbd>). So I’ll never
leave outdated code around.
</li>
<li>When Monday arrives sooner than expected, and I didn’t write anything new, I
can issue <kbd>C-c / T READY</kbd> and get an <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-sparse-tree"><code>org-sparse-tree</code></a> of all <code>READY</code> posts.
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/init-org-ready-state.png"><img src="/images/init-org-ready-state.png" alt="init-org-ready-state.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
See how practical that is? This file is not just the blog and the init file,
it’s also the future posts queue and the “vague ideas” list. All without having
to do manual maintenance. Of course, the headline is automatically marked <code>DONE</code>
when posted.
</p>

<p>
Then there are a few more advantages that arise simply from the fact we’re using
org-mode.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can physically move posts around with <kbd>M-up/down</kbd> and <kbd>M-S-right/left</kbd>, to
whatever order makes more sense, instead of being constrained by alphabetical
or historical order of files.
</li>
<li>By nesting several posts under a headline, any tags or properties applied to
the parent are inherited by the posts. (Killing redundancy, remember?)


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/init-org-news.png"><img src="/images/init-org-news.png" alt="init-org-news.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>The <kbd>C-c C-j</kbd> (<a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/org-goto"><code>org-goto</code></a>) command makes it a breeze to jump around.
</li>
<li>It feels more Emacsy than anything else you could possibly do.
</li>
</ul>

This part applies to any of the org blogging methods (not just my setup), but
still, the org-export engine is extensive and even more so if you know where to
hack it (org links, in particular, are <a href="/use-org-mode-links-for-absolutely-anything.html">extremely versatile</a>).
</p>

<p>
With a single <kbd>C-c b</kbd>, Emacs will spell-check the contents, export to Jekyll,
clean up some links, move the file to the right directory, bring up
<code>magit-status</code>, and even save a commit message to the kill-ring. You could
even have it commit and push automatically too, if you’re a bit of a thrill
seeker.

Well, now that I’ve finished monologuing, the cake is completely gone, there’s
more candy on the floor than on the tables, and I think I hear a child crying
somewhere, so it’s clearly time to wind down the party. Thanks for reading, and
I mean that generally. Thanks for commenting too. Thanks for the emails and the
tweets. Thanks for the bug reports and the pull requests, and any other form of
positive interaction. This was a fun year.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and thanks for coming to the party. Little EP totally didn’t notice that
you didn’t bring a gift. (Though he might notice next year&#x2026; just saying.)
