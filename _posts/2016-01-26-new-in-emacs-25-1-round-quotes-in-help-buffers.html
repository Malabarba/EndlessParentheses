<p>
Don’t be fooled by the apparent simplicity of this feature. Its implementation
has been the most controversial addition to the upcoming Emacs release &#x2014; <a href="https://twitter.com/AMalabarba/status/641598687467163648">to a
comical degree</a>. This post, however, is not about arguments or implementation,
it’s about Emacs 25. And this little nugget is all set for the next release.
</p>

<p>
The feature is simple, next time you’re reading a docstring (maybe via <kbd>C-h f</kbd>
or <kbd>C-h v</kbd>), instead of looking like this<br  />
<a href="/images/help-buffer-grave-quote.png"><img src="/images/help-buffer-grave-quote.png" alt="help-buffer-grave-quote.png" /></a>
it’ll look like this<br  />
<a href="/images/help-buffer-round-quote.png"><img src="/images/help-buffer-round-quote.png" alt="help-buffer-round-quote.png" /></a>
It’s a simple, but noticeable, improvement for user experience. 
</p>

<p>
If you don’t like the change, it’s configurable via the new option:
<code>text-quoting-style</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note that these quotes are introduced directly in the <code>*Help*</code> buffer. The
function that does this conversion is <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/substitute-command-keys"><code>substitute-command-keys</code></a>, so you can use
it if you’d like the same effect for other purposes. You should still use
`grave-and-straight' quotes when <i>writing</i> docstrings for your <code>defun</code>. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if you need to write a straight quote that <i>shouldn’t</i> be
converted to a round quote when it’s printed in the <code>*Help*</code> buffer, you’ll need
to write <code>\\=</code> before it.
</p>
