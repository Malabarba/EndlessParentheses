<p>
A little over a month ago, I released a package called <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/names/"><b>Names</b></a>, designed for
mitigating Emacs' namespace issue. Before I even had a chance to announced it,
it made a bit of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2j4168/names_namespaces_for_emacs_lisp/">a splash</a> on r/emacs, which I've taken to mean that people are
interested. I've been holding off on this post until I had a couple of
Names-using packages under my belt, so I could actually speak from experience as
opposed to expectation, and that's finally the case.
</p>

<p>
<b>Names</b> aims to provide an implementation of namespaces in Emacs-Lisp with four
guiding principles:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Practical </dt><dd>Actually useful and easy to grasp.
</dd>
<dt> Complete </dt><dd>Support any function, macro, or special-form available in
<code>emacs-lisp</code>, <i>even</i> the ones defined by you or a third party.
</dd>
<dt> Robust </dt><dd>No-surprises, well-tested, and with clearly stated limitations.
</dd>
<dt> Debuggable </dt><dd>Support <code>edebug</code>, <code>find-function</code>/ <code>variable</code>/ <code>face</code>,
<code>eval-defun</code>, and <code>eval-last-sexp</code> (also known as <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>).
Integration with other developing tools are under way.

The lack of actual namespaces in elisp is a recurring topic in the Emacs
community. The discussion is long and beyond the scope of this post, so I'll
refer those interested to Nic Ferrier's <a href="http://nic.ferrier.me.uk/blog/2013_06/adding-namespaces-to-elisp">great essay on the subject</a> and to a
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=3500">concise explanation</a> by Jon Snader as well.
</p>

<p>
In short, Emacs takes the approach of prefixing every symbol name with the name
of the package. This successfully avoids name clashes between packages, but it
quickly leads to code that's repetitive and annoying to write. The links above
mentions many shortcomings of this approach, but this code-cluttering repetition
of the package name has always bothered me the most. It makes the code longer
and more tiresome to read
</p>

<p>
See this example from <kbd>package.el</kbd>. The word “package” is repeated 7 times in
a 10-line function.

{% highlight cl %}
;;;###autoload
(defun package-initialize (&optional no-activate)
  "[DOC]"
  (interactive)
  (setq package-alist nil)
  (package-load-all-descriptors)
  (package-read-all-archive-contents)
  (unless no-activate
    (dolist (elt package-alist)
      (package-activate (car elt))))
  (setq package--initialized t))
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="sec-2">What does Names do?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It doesn't change this approach, nor does it try to revolutionize Emacs or
reinvent packages. <b>Names</b> fully adheres to Emacs conventions and is completely
invisible to the end-user, it simply gives <i>you</i> (the developer) a convenient
way of writing code that adheres to this standard.
</p>

<p>
Here's what the code above would look like inside a namespace.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;;;###autoload
(define-namespace package-

:autoload
(defun initialize (&optional no-activate)
  "[DOC]"
  (interactive)
  (setq alist nil)
  (load-all-descriptors)
  (read-all-archive-contents)
  (unless no-activate
    (dolist (elt alist)
      (activate (car elt))))
  (setq -initialized t))
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<code>define-namespace</code> is a macro. At compilation, it expands to generate the exact
same code as the original, thus being completely invisible to the user.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">How reliable is it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I'll forgive you for being sceptical, wrapping your entire package in a macro
sounds risky. Rest assured, <b>Names</b> is very smart in what it does, and it
strives to avoid surprises.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it features a thorough <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/names#tested-on">test suite</a> which leverages off other
well-tested packages to the respectable sum of 244 tests. Of course, the number
by itself has no objective meaning, but it shows that I'm commited to making it
as reliable and robust as possible. To prove I mean business, the last <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/camcorder.el/">two</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode">packages</a> I pushed to Melpa already make use of it. And if that's not enough, I
just got news that <a href="https://github.com/DamienCassou/shell-switcher">shell-switcher</a> has joined the party and seems to be <a href="https://travis-ci.org/DamienCassou/shell-switcher">passing
all tests</a>.
</p>

<p>
In terms of availability, it's on GNU Elpa, so it's a safe dependency for any
Emacs starting with <code>24.1</code>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">And how do I use it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
If you learn better by example, you can have a quick look at this <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/names/blob/master/UsageExample.org">short dummy
package</a> available on the repo or, for real world packages, see <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/camcorder.el/">camcorder.el</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode">aggressive-indent</a>. In any case, it's important to check the <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/names">Readme</a> for the most
up-to-date instructions but here's the gist of it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>List <code>names</code> as a dependency. A typical header will contain 
</li>
</ul>
{% highlight cl %}
;; Package-Requires: ((names "0.5") (emacs "24"))
{% endhighlight %}
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write all code inside the <code>define-namespace</code> macro, preceded by an
<code>;;;###autoload</code> cookie. The first argument of the macro is the prefix which
will be applied to all definitions. <code>require</code> and <code>provide</code> statements go
outside the macro.
</li>
</ul>
{% highlight cl %}
;; `require' statements come first.
(require 'whatever)

;;;###autoload
(define-namespace example-
;;; Code goes here
)

(provide 'example)
;;; example.el ends here
{% endhighlight %}
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inside the macro, instead of using <code>;;;###autoload</code> cookies, use the
<code>:autoload</code> keyword.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And that's pretty much it. Just write your code without prefixing every symbol
with the package name, and Names will take care of that for you. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">1. Every definition gets namespaced</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Any definitions inside will have the prefix prepended to the
symbol given. So the code
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
;;;###autoload
(define-namespace foo-

(defvar bar 1 "docs")

:autoload
(defun free ()
  "DOC"
  (message "hi"))
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
essentially expands to
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defvar foo-bar 1 "docs")

;;;###autoload
(defun foo-free ()
  "DOC"
  (message "hi"))
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">2. Function calls and variables are namespaced if defined</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
This is best explained by example. This code:
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(define-namespace foo-

(defvar var infinite)
(defun infinite (x)
  (infinite x))

(infinite 2) ;; Local function call
(something-else t) ;; External function call
(::infinite var) ;; External function call
infinite ;; Variable
)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
expands to this code:
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defvar foo-myvar infinite)
(defun foo-infinite (x)
  (foo-infinite x))

(foo-infinite 2) ;; Local function call
(something-else t) ;; External function call
(infinite foo-var) ;; External function call.
infinite ;; Variable.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Note how:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>infinite</code> symbol gets namespaced only as a function name, <i>not</i> when it's
used as a variable. That's because <b>Names</b> knows that <code>foo-infinite</code> is not a
defined variable.
</li>
<li>The symbol <code>::infinite</code> is not namespaced, because it had been protected with
<code>::</code>.
</li>
<li><code>something-else</code> is not namespaced, because it is not a locally
defined function, so it must be external.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">3. Quoted forms are not namespaced.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Whenever a form is not meant for evaluation, it is left completely untouched.
The most significant example of this are lists and symbols quoted with a simple
quote (e.g. <code>'foo</code>). These are regarded as data, not code, so you'll have to
write the prefix explicitly inside these quoted forms.
</p>

<p>
Some examples of the <b>opposite</b>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Symbols quoted with a function quote (e.g. <code>#'foo</code>) are regarded as function
names, and are namespaced as explained in <i>item 2</i>. Remember you should <a href="/get-in-the-habit-of-using-sharp-quote.html">use the
function quote</a> for functions anyway.
</li>
<li>Comma forms inside a back-tick form (e.g. <code>`(nothing ,@(function) ,variable)</code>)
<b>are</b> meant for evaluation and so <b>will</b> be namespaced.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">But is it all worth it?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Absolutely! Like I said, I've already written two packages using <b>Names</b>, and I
had a blast! Of course, my opinion is biased. But I can say with all honesty
that it's an absolute <i>delight</i> to not need to worry about all those prefixes.
</p>

<p>
I invite people to try it out. If you do, make sure you <code>(require 'names-dev)</code>
in your init file. This will enable integration with <code>edebug</code>, <code>find-function</code>,
<code>eval-defun</code>, and <code>eval-last-sexp</code>. I've already got news that <a href="https://github.com/DamienCassou/shell-switcher">shell-switcher</a>
has made the conversion, and <code>alchemist</code> seems to be on the way.
