<p>
When developing a package, <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/package-install-from-buffer"><code>package-install-from-buffer</code></a> is a very useful
command. It installs the current buffer as an Elpa package, so you can test
installation, byte-compilation, autoloading, and activation, all in one fell
swoop. If your package has multiple files, however, it gets a little more
complicated.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this month, I <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/7284/50">asked on Emacs.SE</a> whether there was a simple way to
manually install a multifile package. As discussed in <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/7285/50">Phils' answer</a>, you need to
create a <code>-pkg.el</code> file, tar the package, and then invoke a command on the tar
file. That's two steps too many for me, so a push to <code>master</code> was in order.
</p>

<p>
As of today, <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-diffs/2015-01/msg00230.html">Emacs 25.1 has a new feature.</a> From the <code>NEWS</code> file:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
** <code>package-install-from-buffer</code> and <code>package-install-file</code> work on directories.
This follows the same rules as installing from a <code>.tar</code> file, except the
<code>-pkg.el</code> file is optional.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are no new commands to remember. Just issue <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/package-install-from-buffer"><code>package-install-from-buffer</code></a>
from a dired buffer, or invoke <a href="https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/package-install-file"><code>package-install-file</code></a> and give a directory.
Whichever package is contained in that directory will be read and installed, be
it single or multifile, no taring or <code>-pkg.el</code> file necessary.
</p>
