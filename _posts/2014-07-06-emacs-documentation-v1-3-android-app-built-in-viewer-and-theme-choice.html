<p>
I've just released version 1.3 of the Emacs Documentation Android app.
You can
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>download it at the <a href="http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/app.html#main_content">Emacs Online Documentation</a> website,
</li>
<li>or find it at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.malabarba.emacsdocumentation">Play Store</a> (donate version).
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This version addresses a previous annoyance in which you'd have to
zoom-in every time you open a page (because the mobile pages aren't
quite mobile-friendly). This was addressed by implementing a
(optional) built-in viewer which remembers your zoom level.
</p>

<p>
It also implements theme choosing through the settings menu.
